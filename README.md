A comfort library for better and simplify unit test assertion

This sample should demonstrate a way how to optimized unit test
code to keep it cleaner.

A lot of times unit test are testing only methods and properties.
But still the contract. Let us say we put some special attributes
on the classes then we also have to check the contract it selfs.

Ok, if we do later infrastructure test then it also checked if there
are some problems. But for better testing and the way of "TDD" you have
to complete test a class it self.
